## üöÄ Introduction

Welcome to the **AI-Based CAPTCHA Verification System**! This project consists of a **Next.js** frontend and a **FastAPI** backend, leveraging **Redis** for session management. The system is designed to restrict access by presenting mathematical challenges that are automatically solved and verified, ensuring that only authorized AI agents can pass the CAPTCHA.

> **Note:** The version available on GitHub is **not** suitbale for production application environment. The GitHub repository currently contains API keys that are managed through configuration files. A production version includes enhanced security features and will be pushed soon.

If you're interested in accessing the production-ready version, please contact me.

## üåü Features

- **Automated CAPTCHA Challenges:** Generates complex mathematical challenges to verify authorized access.
- **Secure Backend:** Utilizes FastAPI with API key-based authentication to ensure only authorized agents can interact.
- **Session Management:** Implements Redis for efficient and secure session storage.
- **Rate Limiting:** Protects against abuse by limiting the number of requests per API key.
- **Comprehensive Logging:** Facilitates monitoring and debugging with detailed logs.
- **CORS Configuration:** Restricts allowed origins for enhanced security.

## üõ† Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally for development and testing purposes.

### üîß Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Python 3.11** or higher
- **Node.js** (version 14.x or higher)
- **Redis** server
- **Git**

### üì¶ Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-captcha-verification.git
   cd ai-captcha-verification
   ```

2. **Setup Backend (FastAPI)**

   - Navigate to the backend directory:

     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```

   - Create a virtual environment and activate it:

     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - Install dependencies:

     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Setup Frontend (Next.js)**

   - Navigate to the frontend directory:

     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     ```

   - Install dependencies:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

### üõ† Configuration

1. **Backend Configuration**

   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory:

     ```env
     # backend/.env

     # Comma-separated API keys for authorized AI agents
     API_KEYS=your_api_key_1,your_api_key_2,your_api_key_3

     # Redis Configuration
     REDIS_HOST=localhost
     REDIS_PORT=6379
     REDIS_PASSWORD=your_redis_password_if_any

     # CORS Configuration
     ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,https://yourdomain.com
     ```

   - **Generate API Keys:**

     Generate secure API keys using Python's `secrets` module:

     ```python
     import secrets
     print(secrets.token_hex(32))
     ```

     Copy the generated keys and add them to the `API_KEYS` variable, separated by commas.

2. **Frontend Configuration**

   - Create a `.env.local` file in the `frontend` directory:

     ```env
     # frontend/.env.local

     NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
     CAPTCHA_API_KEY=your_api_key_1  # Ensure this matches one of the keys in backend's API_KEYS
     ```

   - **Security Note:** The `CAPTCHA_API_KEY` should **only** be used within Next.js API routes and must **never** be exposed to the client side.

### ‚ñ∂ Running the Project

1. **Start Redis Server**

   Ensure that the Redis server is running. If installed locally, you can start it with:

   ```bash
   redis-server
   ```

2. **Run the Backend Server**

   - Navigate to the backend directory and activate the virtual environment:

     ```bash
     cd backend
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - Start the FastAPI server using Uvicorn:

     ```bash
     uvicorn app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
     ```

3. **Run the Frontend Server**

   - Open a new terminal window, navigate to the frontend directory:

     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```

   - Start the Next.js development server:

     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

4. **Access the Application**

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the AI-Based CAPTCHA Verification System.

## üîí Security Considerations

- **API Key Management:** Ensure that API keys are kept secret and are only shared with authorized AI agents.
- **Secure Redis Configuration:** Use strong passwords and restrict access to the Redis server.
- **CORS Policies:** Only allow trusted origins to interact with your backend API.
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests per API key or IP address.
- **Regular Updates:** Keep all dependencies and packages up-to-date to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
- **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor logs and system metrics to detect and respond to potential security incidents.
